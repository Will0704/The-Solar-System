	<br><h1>Definition</h1>
	<br>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is also the smallest of the eight planets   <img src="mercury internal.jpg" width="300" height="250" align="right">
	<br>in our solar system. For every 2 orbits the Sun, which takes around 88 Earth days, 
	<br>Mercury completes three rotations of its axis. It is gravitationally locked and this 
 	<br>rotation is unique to the solar system.

	<br><h1>Facts</h1>
	<br>- Mercury has been known to humanity since ancient times.

	<br>-Astronomers didn't realize that Mercury was a planet until 1543 when Copernicus published his Sun-centered model of the solar system.
	<br>-The planet has just 38% of the gravity on Earth.
	<br>-Mercury has no moons or rings. 
	<br>-It was once believed that a planet Vulcan existed betweenthe orbit of Mercury and the Sun.
	<br>-The orbit of Mercury is an ellipse rather than circular.

	<br>-Mercury does not experience any seasons.
	<br>-Mercury is the only planet which doesn't rotate exactly once every year.
