	<br>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and second largest planet of the Solar System
	<br>in terms of diameter and mass. If compared, it is easy to see why Saturn and Jupiter 
	<br>have been designed as relatives. From atmospheric composition to rotation, these two 
	<br>planets are extremely similar. Because of these factors, Saturn was named after the father
	<br>of the god Jupiter in Roman Mythology.
