	<br><h1>Definition</h1>												<img src="Earth 1.jpg" width="670" height="350" align="right">
	<br>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and largest of the terrestrial planets.		
	<br>Suprisingly, while it is only the fifth largest planet in terms of size and mass,
	<br>it is the densest of all the planets. Earth is the only planet in the solar system
	<br>not named after a mythological being. Instead, its name is derived from the old english
	<br>word "ertha" and the Anglo-Saxon word "erda" which means ground and soil.
	<br>
	<br>Earth was formed somewhere around 4.54 billion years ago and is currently the only known
	<br>planet to support life-and lots of it.
	<br>
