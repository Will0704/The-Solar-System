	<br>Named after a Roman king of the gods, Jupiter is fitting of its name. With a mass of 1.90 x 10 raise to 27kg
	<br>and a mean diameter of 139,822 km, Jupiter is easily the largest and most massive planet in the Solar System.
	<br>To put this in perspective, it would take 11 Earths lined up next to each other to stretch from one side of
	<br>Jupiter to the other and it woul take 317 Earths to equal the mass of Jupiter.
	<br>
